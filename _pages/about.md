Hi! 👋<br>
I am a second year PhD student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) advised by Professor [Diego Gomez-Zara](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/diego-gomez-zara/).

My research focuses on `generative AI` and `spatial computing`. I develop and analyze novel methods and systems that facilitate collaboration between teams in extended reality spaces, with a focus on Human-AI interactions. I am particularly interested in how integrating AI with immersive technologies can enable teams to achieve innovative results and enhanced experiences. Additionally, I explore the potential of generative AI to boost creativity, support decision-making processes, and facilitate task delegation between teams and AI in virtual reality environments.
