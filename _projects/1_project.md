This project explores the impact of Virtual Reality (VR) on team dynamics, particularly focusing on the relationship between newcomers and established team members. By minimizing physical and social cues, VR can potentially reduce bias and promote inclusivity. Our study investigates how VR affects perceived closeness and familiarity bias within teams. We conducted a controlled experiment to compare in-person and VR settings, analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings highlight the potential of VR to enhance the onboarding experience for new team members and foster stronger team bonds.

To investigate the impact of VR on team dynamics, a controlled between-subjects experiment was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to either an in-person or VR condition, where they collaborated on a hidden-profile task. Data was collected through pre- and post-experiment surveys, measuring perceived closeness, familiarity bias, and task performance. Mixed-methods analysis, combining statistical analysis and thematic analysis, was employed to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data.
