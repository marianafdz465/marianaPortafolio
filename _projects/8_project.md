This research explores the role of online technologies in the work practices of domestic workers, focusing on house cleaners in the United States. Through interviews with 30 domestic workers and a thematic analysis, the study investigates how these workers adopt, repurpose, or avoid online technologies and examines their motivations and outcomes.

The findings introduce the “Crescent Moon Effect” to describe the selective and strategic use of certain technological features by domestic workers while neglecting others that fail to address their needs. While some technologies offer competitive advantages to workers who effectively use them, they generally fall short in transforming broader work conditions, often due to design limitations that exclude domestic workers’ perspectives.

This study highlights that domestic workers’ reluctance to adopt certain technologies is not due to a lack of skills or access but rather the misalignment of these tools with their needs. It calls for the development of inclusive, tailored technologies that empower domestic workers and improve their working conditions. The research contributes to HCI and CSCW fields by providing insights to guide the design of sociotechnical systems that address the unique challenges and potential of domestic workers
