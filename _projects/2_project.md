Is Extended Reality the Next Interface for Human-AI Collaboration?
This project investigates the potential of Extended Reality (XR) as a transformative interface for Human-AI collaboration. By leveraging XRâ€™s immersive environments, we aim to understand how spatial computing and AI agents can enhance teamwork, decision-making, and coordination across diverse field teams. 
We are developing a Mixed Reality (MR) application that integrates an AI-driven Non-Player Character (AI-NPC) designed to assist teams in creative process design. This intelligent virtual agent actively interacts with team members, offering suggestions, facilitating brainstorming sessions, and enhancing group dynamics through real-time feedback.
